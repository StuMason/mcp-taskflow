# TaskFlow Enhancements Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Workflow Stabilization

- [ ] Implement enhanced tool names and descriptions from the proposal
- [ ] Update response templates to include compliance metrics
- [ ] Add session timing requirements to responses
- [ ] Test workflow with multiple AI model interactions to verify consistency

## Phase 2: Dashboard Development

- [ ] Create basic dashboard with session listing and status
- [ ] Add file change visualization (which files changed most frequently)
- [ ] Implement checkpoint timeline view
- [ ] Add decision log viewer with filtering capabilities
- [ ] Create compliance score visualization across sessions
- [ ] Implement basic analytics on session duration and task completion rates

## Phase 3: Context Enhancements (Future)

- [ ] Enhance session initialization with better previous session summaries
- [ ] Add project architecture overview to context initialization
- [ ] Implement outstanding issues/bugs awareness
- [ ] Add basic task progress visualization in responses

## Phase 4: Advanced Reporting (Future)

- [ ] Add technical debt logging capability
- [ ] Implement test coverage tracking
- [ ] Create knowledge base contributions system
- [ ] Add human attention flags for critical decisions

## Phase 5: Cross-Session Learning (Future)

- [ ] Implement best practices database that grows over time
- [ ] Add difficulty assessment for tasks
- [ ] Create session efficiency metrics
- [ ] Build pattern recognition across multiple sessions

## Phase 6: Meta-Analysis (Future)

- [ ] Create meta-model review system to analyze TaskFlow database
- [ ] Implement bottleneck analysis
- [ ] Add automated documentation generation from session history
- [ ] Build tool improvement suggestions based on usage patterns

## Dashboard MVP Requirements

- [ ] Session overview with key metrics
  - Number of sessions
  - Files changed per session
  - Compliance scores
  - Average session duration
- [ ] File change explorer
  - Most frequently modified files
  - File change types over time
  - Content snapshots viewer
- [ ] Decision log explorer
  - Searchable decision database
  - Reasoning and alternatives viewer
  - Decision impact tracking
- [ ] Checkpoint visualization
  - Timeline of progress
  - Progress rate analysis
  - Next steps tracking
- [ ] Task completion metrics
  - Time to completion
  - Tasks by status
  - Feature completion rates

## Database Enhancements Needed

- [ ] Add timestamp tracking for all operations
- [ ] Implement compliance scoring system
- [ ] Add relevance scoring for file changes
- [ ] Create relationship tracking between decisions and file changes
- [ ] Add session efficiency metrics table
